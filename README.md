WHAT I LEARNT
During the course of this project, I was able to improve various skills covered by the first two weeks at Moringa School. I was able to make use of event Listeners to manipulate the DOM. I was also able to learn more on utilize APIs especially public APIs that was the main objective of this project. 
Challenges
The Main challenge in this project was manipulating the public API. I met with several difficulties in making queries to the database in order to receive the appropriate data. While I was able to finally navigate through this, I need more knowledge on the structure of APIs and how to create and manipulate them. Another problem that I encountered was that of styling. I created a template of what I wished my rendered page would look like. However, I was ultimately unable to achieve this vision. Structuring a web page is very hard and issues concerning inheritance are the main difficulting when styling with css.
